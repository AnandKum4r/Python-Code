# #Use of IN Operators
# a="Hello Anand This is your python programming Anand anand anand"
# b=input("Enter the element you want to search ")

# print(a.count(b)) #count() function is used to find number of occrurance

# #Use of NOT IN Operators is just opposite of In

#(8) >Ternary Operators: Single line condition
x=100
y=40
# if(x>y):
#     print("x is greater than y")
# else:
#     print("y is greater than x")

# don't need to write condition multiple time use ternary for single line condtion
# ternianry operators used to store if else condition
g='x is greater than y' if x>y else 'y is greater than x'
print(g)
print("hello anand")
print(g)
